# TODO: Thinking in other approach, cuz not all ESC/JAVA output has col location
# HIP1: The best way is to use a grammar to isolate the variable according to claim
# HIP2: Use the ...^ <- Identifier to get the variable, like this:
#       a = "      if (a[i] < m) {"
#       b = "           ^"
#       list_a = list(a)
#       get_index = (len(list(b)) - 1)
#       print list_a[get_index] <<<< almost there
#       Is necessary to identify first what type of the claim is to gather from claim all needed data
#>>> This transformation seems to be the TRANSLATION
