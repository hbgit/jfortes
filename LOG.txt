[DONE->FILE:jfortes.py] Created a flow to generate main in the jcute model based on the annotations
[DONE->PROJECT] Updated the annotations structure
    - Constructor -> call -> methods
[DONE->PROJECT] Updated the annotations grammar

[TODO->FILE:jfortes.py] Adding annotation extractor into the project

[TODO->PROJECT] Rewrite the annotations

[TODO->PROJECT] Planning to adopt the annotation to generate main in the jcute model
    ==> Actual data:
        - datainput, e.g:
            Line;Variable;From;Scope;Type
            7;a;attribute;class;int[]
        - annotations, e.g:
            (is not in the same line of the method)
            //@ jfortes_getSequenceConstructor name = Bag, args = b, sequence = 1;

        - WARNNING: The data that will be adopted from annotation are join with data gathered runJfortes.generate_data2input
    ==> FLOW:
        (1) Get data from code (method and attributes)
        (2) Generate data from code annotations, only if the program has no main method
