[DONE->FILE:jfortes.py] Created a flow to generate main in the jcute model based on the annotations
[DONE->PROJECT] Updated the annotations structure
    - Constructor -> call -> methods
[DONE->PROJECT] Updated the annotations grammar
[DONE->FILE:jfortes.py] Added annotation extractor into the project
[DONE->PROJECT] Rewrote the annotations


[DOING->PROJECT] Planning to adopt the annotation to generate main in the jcute model
    ==> Actual data:
        - datainput, e.g:
            Line;Variable;From;Scope;Type
            7;a;attribute;class;int[]
        - annotations, e.g:
            (is not in the same line of the method)
            //@ jfortes_constructor name = Bag, args = b, sequence = 1;

        - WARNNING: The data that will be adopted from annotation are join with data gathered runJfortes.generate_data2input
    ==> FLOW:
        HIP1:
        (1) Get data from code (method and attributes)
        (2) Generate data from code annotations, only if the program has no main method
        (3) The code generation should be based on annotations and the additional data from generate_data2input
            (3.1) Running the generate_data2input from each method save the line number and the method name
            [--> generating all constructors]
                [--> generating all class attributes for that constructor]
                [--> generating all class method for that constructor]
            (3.2) For each attribute identify if is a jfortes_attribute and then generate code for each attribute
                  method with from_constructors taking as base sequence from annotations
            (3.3) For each method name identify if is a jfortes_constructor and then generate code for each method
                  with from_constructors taking as base sequence from annotations
